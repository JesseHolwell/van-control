Some notes around my PI install. Poor quality notes probably not useful

Raspberry Pi Zero W 2
Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) Debian Bookworm

Connect
ssh pi@<hostname>
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

Add swap file

Enable Gadget mode

Remove WIFI connection

Configure as AP

Allow WIFIpassthrough

To restart service after pulling the latest code:
